about_service_features_text = <strong> CTFinder (Creative Task Finder) </strong> is a tool by which some people can publish ads about various tasks, while others can find queries of interest to them.\nUnlike job search sites for earning money, <strong> CTFinder </strong> is designed to search for tasks primarily for self-development and maintenance of vitality. Authors of assignments may provide monetary or some other compensation to performers, but it is not originally a primary goal.

about_service_features_text_2 = To notify the author of the desire to implement his proposal, open the detail of the offer on the search page and click <strong> "Join" </strong>. The author will receive a notification with your email address on his email. To receive notifications of all new offers by this author - click <strong>"subscribe"</strong> near his name on the detail window.

about_service_features_text_3 = <strong> CTFinder </strong> only helps authors of tasks and executors find each other, and then they communicate directly, the site does not monitor and control this process. When tasks are taken into use, authors should edit them - reduce the number of vacancies, and if they are fully implemented, suspended or canceled - authors should set their respective statuses. These changes are displayed on the job cards in the search section. An empty field of the number of places means that this number is not limited or has not yet been determined. Jobs with a zero number of places, the ability to install which appears during editing, stop appearing in the search section.

about_service_features_text_4 = Tasks can come from individuals or legal entities. It can be a call to provide volunteer assistance, a proposal to develop an engineering project or simply an invitation to implement the idea. For example, someone considered it important to translate a book from one language to another or wrote a script or conceived an entire enterprise of a new type, but does not have the necessary resources and competencies, and announces its intention to the whole world so that it is not wasted, but was picked up and carried out by people interested in this topic.

about_service_features_text_5 = Free activity in which a person pursues comprehensive self-development as the main goal, and achieves it in the process of creating any direct utility (things, services, information), we call conscious <strong> HB (HumanBuilding) </strong>.

about_service_features_text_6 = All of us since childhood are spontaneous <strong> HB (HumanBuilders) </strong>. Becoming people, getting involved in culture, we already do it actively. Everyone learns to use dishes and cutlery, clothes, shoes and other things, talk, read, write and count. Everyone then learns something to make a living. This is <strong> the first step </strong>, and already on it, developing ourselves, we participate in the creation of the "aggregate Person".

about_service_features_text_7 = <strong> The second step </strong> begins when a hobby appears, when the job search begins, not just bringing money, but also exciting. All spheres of life are subordinated to the goals of the free development of self and others. <strong> CTFinder </strong> was created to automate the meeting of this need.

about_service_features_text_8 = But conscious <strong> HB-activity </strong> often hamper the lack of time, money and, in general, freedom over the circumstances of the social elements. We invite you to unite in order to rise together on the <strong> third stage of HB </strong>. This is the stage of realizing the paramount importance of developing a qualitatively new culture and overcoming with it the global problems that are on our way today. To communicate about this, groups in social networks (<a href="https://vk.com/humanbuilders"> https://vk.com/humanbuilders</a>, <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/groups/150758748845784/"> https://www.facebook.com/groups/150758748845784/</a>) and a special web portal Technocom (<a href ="https://tehnokom.su/">https://tehnokom.su/</a>), we are waiting for you there!
